### Execution Steps in Detail

### 1. **FROM Clause**: Retrieve data from `products` and `regions` tables.

- **`products`**:

  | **product_id** | **category**   | **sales_amount** |
  |----------------|----------------|------------------|
  | 1              | Electronics    | 15               |
  | 2              | Electronics    | 25               |
  | 3              | Electronics    | 5                |
  | 4              | Appliances     | 10               |
  | 5              | Appliances     | 20               |
  | 6              | Furniture      | 30               |

- **`regions`**:

  | **product_id** | **region_name** |
  |----------------|-----------------|
  | 1              | North           |
  | 2              | South           |
  | 4              | East            |
  | 6              | West            |

---

### 2. **JOIN Clause** (INNER JOIN `products` and `regions` ON `p.product_id = r.product_id`):

- Combine rows from both tables where `product_id` matches between the two tables.

**Result after JOIN**:

| **product_id** | **category**   | **sales_amount** | **region_name** |
|----------------|----------------|------------------|-----------------|
| 1              | Electronics    | 15               | North           |
| 2              | Electronics    | 25               | South           |
| 4              | Appliances     | 10               | East            |
| 6              | Furniture      | 30               | West            |

---

### 3. **WHERE Clause** (`sales_amount > 10`):

- Exclude rows where `sales_amount <= 10`.

**Filtered Data**:

| **product_id** | **category**   | **sales_amount** | **region_name** |
|----------------|----------------|------------------|-----------------|
| 1              | Electronics    | 15               | North           |
| 2              | Electronics    | 25               | South           |
| 6              | Furniture      | 30               | West            |

---

### 4. **GROUP BY Clause** (`p.product_id`, `p.category`, `p.sales_amount`, `r.region_name`):

- **Explanation**:
    - Rows are grouped based on the columns: `product_id`, `category`, `sales_amount`, and `region_name`.
    - Since each combination is unique, every row forms its own group.

**Visualization of Groups**:

| **Group No.** | **product_id** | **category**   | **sales_amount** | **region_name** |
|---------------|----------------|----------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Group 1       | 1              | Electronics    | 15               | North           |
| Group 2       | 2              | Electronics    | 25               | South           |
| Group 3       | 6              | Furniture      | 30               | West            |

---

### 5. **HAVING Clause** (`COUNT(*) > 0`):

- All groups satisfy the condition of `COUNT(*) > 0`, so no rows are filtered out.

**Data after HAVING**:

| **product_id** | **category**   | **sales_amount** | **region_name** |
|----------------|----------------|------------------|-----------------|
| 1              | Electronics    | 15               | North           |
| 2              | Electronics    | 25               | South           |
| 6              | Furniture      | 30               | West            |

---

### 6. **Window Function**: Calculate the total sales for each category.

- Use `SUM(p.sales_amount) OVER (PARTITION BY p.category)` to calculate the total sales per category.

**Output with Window Function**:

| **product_id** | **category**   | **sales_amount** | **region_name** | **total_category_sales** |
|----------------|----------------|------------------|-----------------|--------------------------|
| 1              | Electronics    | 15               | North           | 40                       |
| 2              | Electronics    | 25               | South           | 40                       |
| 6              | Furniture      | 30               | West            | 30                       |

---

### 7. **SELECT Clause**:

- Retrieve the columns specified in the SELECT statement.

**Output after SELECT**:

| **product_id** | **sales_amount** | **category**   | **region_name** | **total_category_sales** |
|----------------|------------------|----------------|-----------------|--------------------------|
| 1              | 15               | Electronics    | North           | 40                       |
| 2              | 25               | Electronics    | South           | 40                       |
| 6              | 30               | Furniture      | West            | 30                       |

---

### 8. **ORDER BY Clause** (`p.sales_amount DESC`):

- Sort rows by `sales_amount` in descending order.

**Sorted Output**:

| **product_id** | **sales_amount** | **category**   | **region_name** | **total_category_sales** |
|----------------|------------------|----------------|-----------------|--------------------------|
| 6              | 30               | Furniture      | West            | 30                       |
| 2              | 25               | Electronics    | South           | 40                       |
| 1              | 15               | Electronics    | North           | 40                       |

---

### 9. **LIMIT Clause** (`LIMIT 3`):

- Limit the output to the first 3 rows.

**Final Output**:

| **product_id** | **sales_amount** | **category**   | **region_name** | **total_category_sales** |
|----------------|------------------|----------------|-----------------|--------------------------|
| 6              | 30               | Furniture      | West            | 30                       |
| 2              | 25               | Electronics    | South           | 40                       |
| 1              | 15               | Electronics    | North           | 40                       |

### Notes

- **String concatenation** using `||` is deprecated in MySQL; instead, use the `CONCAT()` function for better compatibility.
- `EXCEPT` and `INTERSECT` are not natively supported in MySQL; these can be emulated using joins or subqueries.

<h3 align="center"> JOINS </h3>

---

JOINS in SQL are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. JOINS allow you to fetch data from multiple tables in a meaningful way.

---

## **INNER JOIN**

The `INNER JOIN` retrieves rows where there’s a **match** between the tables based on a given condition.

### **Syntax**
```sql
SELECT table1.column1, table2.column2
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.common_column = table2.common_column;
```

### **Example**

#### Tables:
1. `employees`:

   | **id** | **name**    | **department_id** |
   |--------|-------------|-------------------|
   | 1      | Alice       | 101               |
   | 2      | Bob         | 102               |
   | 3      | Charlie     | 103               |

2. `departments`:

   | **department_id** | **department_name** |
   |-------------------|---------------------|
   | 101               | HR                  |
   | 102               | Finance             |
   | 104               | IT                  |

#### Query:
```sql
SELECT employees.name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
INNER JOIN departments
ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;
```

#### Result:
| **name** | **department_name** |
|----------|----------------------|
| Alice    | HR                   |
| Bob      | Finance              |

- **Explanation**: Only rows with a matching `department_id` in both tables are returned (103 and 104 are excluded as they don’t find matches).

---

## **LEFT JOIN (LEFT OUTER JOIN)**

The `LEFT JOIN` retrieves all rows from the **left** table, even when there is no matching row in the right table. Non-matching rows will have `NULL` values for right-side columns.

### **Syntax**
```sql
SELECT table1.column1, table2.column2
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2
ON table1.common_column = table2.common_column;
```

### **Example**
#### Query:
```sql
SELECT employees.name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
LEFT JOIN departments
ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;
```

#### Result:
| **name**    | **department_name** |
|-------------|----------------------|
| Alice       | HR                   |
| Bob         | Finance              |
| Charlie     | NULL                 |

- **Explanation**: The row for "Charlie" has `NULL` in `department_name` because 103 is not present in the departments table.

---

## **RIGHT JOIN (RIGHT OUTER JOIN)**

The `RIGHT JOIN` is the reverse of the `LEFT JOIN`. It retrieves all rows from the **right** table, even when there’s no matching row in the left table. Non-matching rows will have `NULL` values for left-side columns.

### **Syntax**
```sql
SELECT table1.column1, table2.column2
FROM table1
RIGHT JOIN table2
ON table1.common_column = table2.common_column;
```

### **Example**
#### Query:
```sql
SELECT employees.name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
RIGHT JOIN departments
ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;
```

#### Result:
| **name**    | **department_name** |
|-------------|----------------------|
| Alice       | HR                   |
| Bob         | Finance              |
| NULL        | IT                   |

- **Explanation**: The row for the "IT" department has `NULL` for `name` because no employee is assigned to it.

---

## **FULL OUTER JOIN**

The `FULL OUTER JOIN` retrieves all records where there is a match in **either** table or from **both** tables. Non-matching rows have `NULL` in columns of the table that doesn't have the data.

### **Syntax**
```sql
SELECT table1.column1, table2.column2
FROM table1
FULL OUTER JOIN table2
ON table1.common_column = table2.common_column;
```

### **Example**
#### Query:
```sql
SELECT employees.name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
FULL OUTER JOIN departments
ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;
```

#### Result:
| **name**    | **department_name** |
|-------------|----------------------|
| Alice       | HR                   |
| Bob         | Finance              |
| Charlie     | NULL                 |
| NULL        | IT                   |

- **Explanation**: Combines `LEFT` and `RIGHT JOIN`. All unmatched rows from both sides appear with `NULL` for missing data. Note: Some databases like MySQL do not natively support `FULL OUTER JOIN`. A workaround using `UNION` is typically used in those cases.

---

<h3 align="center"> SELF JOIN </h3>

---

A **Self JOIN** is when a table is joined with itself. You treat the same table as if it were two separate tables by using **aliases**. This is typically used when one row in a table relates to another row in the same table, and you want to compare or link those rows.

---

### **Syntax of Self JOIN**
```sql
SELECT A.column1, B.column2
FROM table_name A
JOIN table_name B
ON A.common_column = B.common_column;
```
- `A` and `B` are **aliases** used to reference the same table in the query.
- The `ON` condition defines the relationship between two rows of the same table.

#### Example: Employee-Manager Relationship
| **id** | **name** | **manager_id** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Alice | NULL |
| 2 | Bob | 1 |
| 3 | Charlie | 1 |
| 4 | David | 2 |

- Here, `id` represents an employee, and `manager_id` shows the employee's manager.
- To find the **manager name** for each employee, we can apply a Self JOIN:
```sql
  SELECT E.name AS employee_name, M.name AS manager_name
  FROM employees E
  LEFT JOIN employees M
  ON E.manager_id = M.id;
```

<h3 align="center"> GROUP BY and HAVING</h3>

---

## 1. GROUP BY Clause

The `GROUP BY` clause organizes rows in a dataset into groups based on one or more columns. It is typically used in conjunction with aggregate functions (like `SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`) to summarize data for each group.

### Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, AGGREGATE_FUNCTION(column3)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column1, column2;
```

- **column1, column2**: Columns used for grouping rows.
- **AGGREGATE_FUNCTIONs**: Functions such as `SUM()`, `COUNT()`.

### Key Points
- Most columns in the `SELECT` statement must either:
    - Be part of the `GROUP BY`, or
    - Be aggregated by a function like `SUM()`.
- `GROUP BY` collapses multiple rows into single rows for each group.

### Example of GROUP BY

Suppose we have a table `sales`:

| **id** | **category**    | **region** | **quantity** | **price** |
|--------|-----------------|------------|--------------|-----------|
| 1      | Electronics     | North      | 10           | 150       |
| 2      | Electronics     | South      | 5            | 200       |
| 3      | Furniture       | North      | 7            | 300       |
| 4      | Furniture       | North      | 8            | 400       |
| 5      | Electronics     | North      | 2            | 150       |

#### Query: Find the total quantity sold per category:
```sql
SELECT category, SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity
FROM sales
GROUP BY category;
```

**Output:**

| **category**    | **total_quantity** |
|------------------|--------------------|
| Electronics      | 17                 |
| Furniture        | 15                 |

---

## 2. HAVING Clause

The `HAVING` clause is used to filter groups **after grouping**. It allows you to apply conditions to aggregated results.

### Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1, AGGREGATE_FUNCTION(column2)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column1
HAVING AGGREGATE_FUNCTION(column2) condition;
```

### Example of HAVING

#### Query: Find categories with total quantity sold greater than 15:
```sql
SELECT category, SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity
FROM sales
GROUP BY category
HAVING total_quantity > 15;
```

**Output:**

| **category**    | **total_quantity** |
|------------------|--------------------|
| Electronics      | 17                 |

---

## Points to consider while using GROUP BY and HAVING

### 1. **Using Columns in SELECT Without GROUP BY**
- **Error:** "Column is not in the GROUP BY clause or not aggregated."
- **Cause:** Referencing columns not included in `GROUP BY` or aggregate functions.
- **Example:**
  ```sql
  SELECT category, region, SUM(quantity)
  FROM sales
  GROUP BY category;
  ```
    - **Error:** `region` must appear in the `GROUP BY` clause or be an aggregate function.

### 2. **Using WHERE Instead of HAVING**
- The `WHERE` clause cannot filter aggregated results. Use `HAVING` for conditions based on aggregate functions.
- **Incorrect:**
  ```sql
  SELECT category, SUM(quantity)
  FROM sales
  WHERE SUM(quantity) > 15; -- Error
  ```
- **Correct:**
  ```sql
  SELECT category, SUM(quantity)
  FROM sales
  GROUP BY category
  HAVING SUM(quantity) > 15;
  ```

### 3. **Grouping by Too Many Columns**
- Including unnecessary columns in `GROUP BY` can split results into unintended groups.
- **Example:**
  ```sql
  SELECT category, region, SUM(quantity)
  FROM sales
  GROUP BY category, region;
  ```
    - Groups will be created for each combination of `category` and `region`.

### 4. Leverage Aliases in HAVING for Readability
- Use column aliases to simplify expressions in the `HAVING` clause.

**Example:**
   ```sql
   SELECT category, SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity
   FROM sales
   GROUP BY category
   HAVING total_quantity > 15;
   ```
- When you alias a column or expression in the `SELECT` clause — in this case, `SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity` — you 
  might think the alias isn't available in the earlier, logical step (`HAVING`) because `HAVING` is executed before 
 `SELECT`. However, many SQL implementations, including MySQL, allow alias names to be reused in the `HAVING` clause as 
 a shortcut to improve code readability. would need to internally rewrite the `HAVING` clause as:
```sql
  HAVING SUM(quantity) > 15;
```



### 4. **Null Values in GROUP BY**
- Null values in grouped columns are treated as separate groups. Null handling should be deliberate, using `COALESCE()` if needed.
- Use `COALESCE()` to replace nulls with default values.
- Example:
  ```sql
  SELECT category, COALESCE(SUM(quantity), 0) AS total_quantity
  FROM sales
  GROUP BY category;
  ```
---

<h3 align="center"> DISTINCT and LIMIT</h3>

---

## **1. DISTINCT – Handling Duplicates**

The `DISTINCT` keyword is used in SQL to remove duplicate rows from the result set. When a query with `DISTINCT` is executed, it returns only unique rows based on the selected column(s).

### **Syntax**
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;
```

### **How It Works**
- SQL compares the selected columns in the `DISTINCT` clause.
- If two or more rows have identical values in all the selected fields, only one of those rows is returned.

### **Example**

#### Table: `students`

| **id** | **name**    | **class** | **subject**  |
|--------|-------------|-----------|--------------|
| 1      | Alice       | 10        | Math         |
| 2      | Bob         | 10        | Science      |
| 3      | Charlie     | 10        | Math         |
| 4      | Alice       | 10        | Math         |

#### Query: Get unique combinations of `name` and `class`:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT name, class
FROM students;
```

#### Result:
| **name**    | **class** |
|-------------|-----------|
| Alice       | 10        |
| Bob         | 10        |
| Charlie     | 10        |

- The duplicate row for "Alice" has been removed because the combination of `name` and `class` was the same as another row.

---

### **Key Considerations of DISTINCT**

1. **Distinct Applies to the Entire Row**:
    - The `DISTINCT` keyword removes duplicates based on **all the columns** selected in the query.
    - If you use only one column, it will remove duplicates for that column only.

   **Query Example:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT subject
   FROM students;
   ```
   **Result:**

   | **subject**  |
   |--------------|
   | Math         |
   | Science      |

   In this case, duplicates are removed **only for the `subject` column**, even if the rest of the columns have duplicates.

2. **DISTINCT and Aggregate Functions**:
    - You can pair `DISTINCT` with aggregate functions to eliminate duplicates before performing calculations.

   **Example**: Find the count of unique `subject` values:
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT subject)
   FROM students;
   ```

---

### **2. LIMIT – Limiting the Results of a Query**

The `LIMIT` clause is used to specify the number of rows to retrieve from the executed query results. It's particularly useful for:
- Fetching sample data.
- Returning only the **top N rows** from a dataset.

### **Syntax**
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
LIMIT number_of_rows [OFFSET offset];
```

- `LIMIT number_of_rows`: Fetches the specified number of rows.
- `OFFSET offset`: Skips the first `offset` rows and starts returning rows after the offset.

---

### **How It Works**

The result set is generated first, and then the `LIMIT` clause is applied to restrict how many rows are returned.

---

### **Example**

#### Table: `students`

| **id** | **name**    | **class** | **subject**  |
|--------|-------------|-----------|--------------|
| 1      | Alice       | 10        | Math         |
| 2      | Bob         | 10        | Science      |
| 3      | Charlie     | 10        | Math         |
| 4      | David       | 9         | Math         |

#### Query: Retrieve the top 2 students:
```sql
SELECT name, class, subject
FROM students
LIMIT 2;
```

**Result:**

| **name**    | **class** | **subject**  |
|-------------|-----------|--------------|
| Alice       | 10        | Math         |
| Bob         | 10        | Science      |

---

### **Using LIMIT with OFFSET**

The `OFFSET` clause is used to skip a specific number of rows in the result set before returning rows.

#### Query: Retrieve the 2nd and 3rd students in the result set:
```sql
SELECT name, class, subject
FROM students
LIMIT 2 OFFSET 1;
```

**Result:**

| **name**    | **class** | **subject**  |
|-------------|-----------|--------------|
| Bob         | 10        | Science      |
| Charlie     | 10        | Math         |

- Rows are retrieved starting from the **2nd row (OFFSET 1)**.

---

### **Combining DISTINCT and LIMIT**

You can combine both `DISTINCT` and `LIMIT` in a query. The `DISTINCT` clause is applied **first** to remove duplicates, and then the `LIMIT` clause is applied to limit the number of rows.

#### Query: Get the first 2 unique subjects:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT subject
FROM students
LIMIT 2;
```

**Result:**

| **subject**  |
|--------------|
| Math         |
| Science      |

---

## **Common Errors Using DISTINCT and LIMIT**

### **1. Using DISTINCT in Aggregate Functions Improperly**
- **Error:** When using `DISTINCT` with aggregate functions, ensure proper syntax.
- **Example:**
  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT name, class) 
  FROM students;
  ```
    - **Fix:** `DISTINCT` works for only one column:
  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT name)
  FROM students;
  ```

### **2. Misunderstanding DISTINCT Order of Application**
- **Error:** Assuming `DISTINCT` respects the order of your result set.
- **Cause:** The `DISTINCT` clause doesn’t maintain a specific order in the results because it removes duplicates **before sorting**.

- **Fix:** Use `ORDER BY` *after* `DISTINCT` to ensure sorting:
  ```sql
  SELECT DISTINCT subject
  FROM students
  ORDER BY subject ASC;
  ```

### **3. Using LIMIT Without Defining a Sort Order**
- **Error:** The `LIMIT` clause without `ORDER BY` may return inconsistent results, as there is no guarantee of row order.
- **Fix:** Always use `ORDER BY` when using `LIMIT`:
  ```sql
  SELECT name, subject
  FROM students
  ORDER BY name ASC
  LIMIT 3;
  ```

### **4. Combining DISTINCT with LIMIT in Unexpected Ways**
- **Error:** Assuming `LIMIT` applies before `DISTINCT`.
- **Cause:** `DISTINCT` is applied before limiting, so `LIMIT` counts only after duplicates are removed.
- **Fix:** Remove duplicates first deliberately, and then limit rows:
  ```sql
  SELECT DISTINCT subject
  FROM students
  LIMIT 2;
  ```

### **5. Using OFFSET Without Handling Ordering**
- **Error:** Like `LIMIT`, using `OFFSET` without specifying an ordering (`ORDER BY`) may result in an unpredictable row order being skipped.
- **Fix:** Use `ORDER BY` with `OFFSET`:
  ```sql
  SELECT name
  FROM students
  ORDER BY id ASC
  LIMIT 2 OFFSET 2;
  ```
---

<h3 align="center"> Subqueries </h3>

---

A **subquery** (or inner query) is a query that is nested inside another query, known as the **outer query**. Subqueries allow you to perform operations in multiple steps by:
- Returning values to be used by the outer query for filtering, calculations, or joins.
- Providing additional flexibility for tackling complex business scenarios.

---

## **Syntax of Subqueries**
Subqueries can be used in different places in a query, such as:
1. In the `WHERE` clause to filter rows.
2. In the `FROM` clause as a temporary table.
3. In the `SELECT` clause to generate calculated columns.

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name operator (SELECT column FROM table_name WHERE condition);
```

---

## **Types of Subqueries**

Subqueries can be categorized into the following types based on how they’re used:

### **1. Scalar Subquery**
- Returns **a single value** (one row, one column).
- Used in `SELECT`, `WHERE`, or `HAVING` clauses.

### **2. Multi-row Subquery**
- Returns multiple rows in a single column.
- Requires operators like `IN`, `ANY`, or `EXISTS`.

### **3. Multi-column Subquery**
- Returns multiple rows and multiple columns.
- Used in conjunction with comparisons of multiple fields.

### **4. Correlated Subquery**
- A subquery that depends on the outer query for its values. These are evaluated row by row.

---

## **Examples of Subqueries**

### **1. Subquery in WHERE Clause**
You can use a subquery in the `WHERE` clause to filter rows based on the result of another query.

#### Example: Find employees who work in the same department as "Alice".

**Table: employees**

| **id** | **name**  | **department_id** |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| 1      | Alice     | 101               |
| 2      | Bob       | 102               |
| 3      | Charlie   | 101               |
| 4      | David     | 103               |

**Query:**
```sql
SELECT name
FROM employees
WHERE department_id = (
    SELECT department_id
    FROM employees
    WHERE name = 'Alice'
);
```

**Result:**

| **name**    |
|-------------|
| Alice       |
| Charlie     |

**Explanation:**
- The inner query retrieves `department_id` for "Alice" (`department_id = 101`).
- The outer query fetches all employees with this `department_id`.

---

### **2. Subquery in SELECT Clause**
Subqueries can be used within the `SELECT` clause to calculate a value for each row.

#### Example: Add the total sales made by each employee as a column.

**Table: sales**

| **employee_id** | **amount** |
|-----------------|------------|
| 1               | 500        |
| 2               | 300        |
| 1               | 300        |
| 3               | 100        |

**Query:**
```sql
SELECT e.name,
       (SELECT SUM(s.amount)
        FROM sales s
        WHERE s.employee_id = e.id) AS total_sales
FROM employees e;
```

**Result:**

| **name**    | **total_sales** |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Alice       | 800             |
| Bob         | 300             |
| Charlie     | 100             |
| David       | NULL            |

**Explanation:**
- The subquery calculates the total sales amount (`SUM(amount)`) for each employee by matching `employee_id` with `e.id`.

---

### **3. Subquery in FROM Clause (Derived Table)**
You can use subqueries in the `FROM` clause to create a temporary table that the outer query can work with.

#### Example: Find departments with more than one employee.

**Query:**
```sql
SELECT department_id, employee_count
FROM (
    SELECT department_id, COUNT(*) AS employee_count
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY department_id
) AS temp
WHERE employee_count > 1;
```

**Result:**

| **department_id** | **employee_count** |
|-------------------|--------------------|
| 101               | 2                  |

**Explanation:**
- The subquery creates a temporary table (`temp`) that includes each department's employee count.
- The outer query filters results where the count is greater than 1.

---

### **4. Correlated Subquery**
A **correlated subquery** references the outer query for each row and is executed repeatedly for every row in the outer query.

#### Example: Find employees who have a sales amount greater than the **average sales amount**.

**Query:**
```sql
SELECT e.name
FROM employees e
WHERE (
    SELECT AVG(s.amount)
    FROM sales s
    WHERE s.employee_id = e.id
) > 300;
```

**Result:**

| **name**  |
|-----------|
| Alice     |

**Explanation:**
- The subquery calculates the **average sales amount** for each employee.
- Rows are returned where the average sales amount is greater than 300.

---

## **Common Errors and Pitfalls with Subqueries**

### **1. Using a Subquery with Incorrect Cardinality**
- **Error:** "Subquery returns more than 1 row."
- **Cause:** Using a subquery that returns multiple rows where only one row is expected.
- **Example:**
  ```sql
  SELECT name
  FROM employees
  WHERE department_id = (SELECT department_id FROM employees);
  ```
    - Subquery returns **multiple rows**, which causes an error.

- **Fix:** Use `IN` or `ANY` if the subquery returns multiple rows.
  ```sql
  SELECT name
  FROM employees
  WHERE department_id IN (SELECT department_id FROM employees);
  ```

---

### **2. Performance Issues with Correlated Subqueries**
- **Cause:** Correlated subqueries are executed once for each row in the outer query, which can lead to poor performance on large datasets.
- **Fix:** Rewrite correlated subqueries using **JOINs**, which are often more efficient.
  **Example:**
  ```sql
  SELECT e.name
  FROM employees e
  JOIN (
      SELECT employee_id, AVG(amount) AS avg_sales
      FROM sales
      GROUP BY employee_id
  ) AS avg_sales_table
  ON e.id = avg_sales_table.employee_id
  WHERE avg_sales_table.avg_sales > 300;
  ```

---

### **3. Misusing Subqueries in `FROM` Clause**
- **Error:** Naming conflicts or missing aliases in derived tables.
- **Cause:** Forgetting to provide an alias for a subquery in the `FROM` clause.
- **Example (Invalid):**
  ```sql
  SELECT *
  FROM (SELECT department_id, COUNT(*) AS employee_count
        FROM employees
        GROUP BY department_id);
  ```
- **Fix:** Always assign an alias (`temp`) to the subquery:
  ```sql
  SELECT *
  FROM (SELECT department_id, COUNT(*) AS employee_count
        FROM employees
        GROUP BY department_id) AS temp;
  ```

---

<h3 align="center"> Window Functions: Analyzing Data Over Partitions </h3>

---

Window functions are SQL functions that perform calculations **across a set of table rows** that are related to the current row. Unlike aggregate functions (like `SUM` or `AVG`), window functions do not group rows into a single output row; instead, they **return a value for every row** in the result set.

---

## **ROW_NUMBER, RANK, and DENSE_RANK**

Among the most commonly used window functions in SQL are:
- **ROW_NUMBER**: Assigns a unique sequential number to each row in a partition.
- **RANK**: Assigns a **rank** to each row in a partition based on sorting. Rows with duplicate values receive duplicate ranks, and the next rank skips numbers.
- **DENSE_RANK**: Similar to `RANK`, but **does not skip numbers** after duplicates.

---

## **Syntax**

The general syntax for using window functions is:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, 
       function_name() OVER (
         PARTITION BY column_to_partition -- Optional
         ORDER BY column_to_sort
       ) AS new_column
FROM table_name;
```

- **OVER ():**
  Specifies the window (set of rows) where the function is applied.
- **PARTITION BY:**
  Divides the data into partitions (like groups for each `department_id` in an employee table). The window function is applied within each partition.
- **ORDER BY:**
  Specifies the sort order for assigning ranks or row numbers within each partition.

---

## **1. ROW_NUMBER: Assigning Unique Numbers to Rows**

The `ROW_NUMBER` function assigns a unique sequential number to each row. It starts from **1** for each partition and increments by **1** for each new row.

### **Example: Get a Unique Row Number for Each Employee Within Their Department**

#### Table: employees

| **employee_id** | **name**    | **department_id** | **salary** |
|-----------------|-------------|-------------------|------------|
| 1               | Alice       | 101               | 5000       |
| 2               | Bob         | 102               | 4000       |
| 3               | Charlie     | 101               | 4500       |
| 4               | David       | 101               | 6000       |
| 5               | Eve         | 102               | 7000       |

**Query:**
```sql
SELECT employee_id, name, department_id, salary,
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary DESC) AS row_number
FROM employees;
```

**Result:**

| **employee_id** | **name**    | **department_id** | **salary** | **row_number** |
|-----------------|-------------|-------------------|------------|----------------|
| 4               | David       | 101               | 6000       | 1              |
| 1               | Alice       | 101               | 5000       | 2              |
| 3               | Charlie     | 101               | 4500       | 3              |
| 5               | Eve         | 102               | 7000       | 1              |
| 2               | Bob         | 102               | 4000       | 2              |

### **Use Case:**
`ROW_NUMBER` is useful when you need a **unique identifier** for a row within a specific partition or sorted dataset.

---

## **2. RANK: Assigning Ranks with Gaps for Ties**

The `RANK` function assigns a rank to each row based on the `ORDER BY` clause. If multiple rows have the same value, they receive the same rank, but the **next rank skips numbers**.

### **Example: Rank Employees by Salary Within Each Department**

**Query:**
```sql
SELECT employee_id, name, department_id, salary,
       RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank
FROM employees;
```

**Result:**

| **employee_id** | **name**    | **department_id** | **salary** | **rank** |
|-----------------|-------------|-------------------|------------|----------|
| 4               | David       | 101               | 6000       | 1        |
| 1               | Alice       | 101               | 5000       | 2        |
| 3               | Charlie     | 101               | 4500       | 3        |
| 5               | Eve         | 102               | 7000       | 1        |
| 2               | Bob         | 102               | 4000       | 2        |

### **Use Case:**
`RANK` is useful when you need to **rank rows with ties**, but still want to identify gaps in the rankings.

---

## **3. DENSE_RANK: Assigning Consecutive Ranks Without Gaps**

The `DENSE_RANK` function is similar to `RANK`, but it **does not skip numbers**. When rows are tied, the next rank is assigned sequentially.

### **Example: Assign Dense Ranks to Employees by Salary Within Each Department**

**Query:**
```sql
SELECT employee_id, name, department_id, salary,
       DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary DESC) AS dense_rank
FROM employees;
```

**Result:**

| **employee_id** | **name**    | **department_id** | **salary** | **dense_rank** |
|-----------------|-------------|-------------------|------------|----------------|
| 4               | David       | 101               | 6000       | 1              |
| 1               | Alice       | 101               | 5000       | 2              |
| 3               | Charlie     | 101               | 4500       | 3              |
| 5               | Eve         | 102               | 7000       | 1              |
| 2               | Bob         | 102               | 4000       | 2              |

### **Use Case:**
`DENSE_RANK` is useful when you need **continuous ranking** (without skipping numbers) regardless of ties.

---

## **Differences Between ROW_NUMBER, RANK, and DENSE_RANK**

| **Function**   | **Handles Ties**            | **Skips Numbers for Ties** | **Purpose**                                |
|----------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **ROW_NUMBER** | Treats tied rows uniquely   | N/A                        | Assigns a unique sequential number.        |
| **RANK**       | Assigns same rank to ties   | Yes                        | Used to rank rows with gaps for ties.      |
| **DENSE_RANK** | Assigns same rank to ties   | No                         | Ranks rows continuously without gaps.      |

## **Common Errors When Using Window Functions**

### **1. Misusing PARTITION BY**
- **Error:** "Incorrect results or lack of grouping."
- **Cause:** Omitting or incorrectly using `PARTITION BY` leads to incorrect grouping.
- **Example:**
  ```sql
  SELECT employee_id, name, department_id,
         ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS row_number
  FROM employees;
  ```
    - This assigns a global row number instead of partitioning by department.
- **Fix:**
  Add `PARTITION BY` for proper grouping:
  ```sql
  SELECT employee_id, name, department_id,
         ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary DESC) AS row_number
  FROM employees;
  ```

### **2. Ignoring ORDER BY**
- **Error:** "Unpredictable rank/order assignments."
- **Cause:** Failing to specify an `ORDER BY` clause results in SQLite-like improper ordering.
- **Fix:**
  Always specify a clear column to sort within the window.

### **3. Using Window Functions Without `OVER` Clause**
- **Error:** Missing `OVER` clause results in syntax errors.
- **Fix:**
  Ensure you include the `OVER ()` clause:
  ```sql
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY column_name)
  ```

### **4. Performance Issues in Large Datasets**
- **Cause:** Window functions are computationally expensive as they operate row by row.
- **Fix:**
    - Use optimizations like indexes.
    - Only retrieve rows necessary for the results by limiting columns and rows in the query.

---

<h3 align="center">CASE Statements: Conditional Logic in Your Queries </h3>

---

The `CASE` statement in SQL allows you to **implement conditional logic within your queries**. It works like an `IF-THEN-ELSE` statement in programming. With `CASE`, you evaluate a condition for each row in the dataset and return a specific value based on whether the condition is true or false.

It is commonly used for:
- Creating calculated columns based on conditions.
- Transforming data for more readable outputs.
- Simplifying complex querying logic.

---

## **Syntax of CASE Statement**

`CASE` expressions come in two forms:

### **1. Simple CASE (Compares a Single Expression Against Values):**
```sql
CASE expression
    WHEN value1 THEN result1
    WHEN value2 THEN result2
    ...
    ELSE result
END
```

- **Expression**: This is the value (column or calculation) that is compared with `value1`, `value2`, etc.
- **`WHEN`**: Specifies the condition or value to be evaluated.
- **`THEN`**: Specifies the result of that condition.
- **`ELSE`** (Optional): Specifies the default result if none of the conditions are met.
- **`END`**: Marks the end of the `CASE` statement.

---

### **2. Searched CASE (Evaluates Boolean Conditions):**
```sql
CASE
    WHEN condition1 THEN result1
    WHEN condition2 THEN result2
    ...
    ELSE result
END
```

- Instead of comparing a single expression, each `WHEN` has its **own condition** (a Boolean expression like `<`, `>`, `=`, etc.).

---

## **Examples of CASE Statements**

### **1. Creating Categorized Outputs**

Example: Categorize employees based on their salary range.

#### Table: employees

| **employee_id** | **name**    | **salary** |
|-----------------|-------------|------------|
| 1               | Alice       | 6000       |
| 2               | Bob         | 4000       |
| 3               | Charlie     | 7500       |
| 4               | David       | 3000       |

#### Query:
```sql
SELECT name, salary,
       CASE 
           WHEN salary >= 7000 THEN 'High'
           WHEN salary >= 5000 THEN 'Medium'
           ELSE 'Low'
       END AS salary_category
FROM employees;
```

#### Result:
| **name**    | **salary** | **salary_category** |
|-------------|------------|---------------------|
| Alice       | 6000       | Medium              |
| Bob         | 4000       | Low                 |
| Charlie     | 7500       | High                |
| David       | 3000       | Low                 |

**Explanation:**
- Each row is evaluated against the conditions in the `CASE` statement.
    - Salaries above `7000` are categorized as **High**.
    - Salaries between `5000-6999` are categorized as **Medium**.
    - Salaries below `5000` fall into **Low** (handled by the `ELSE` clause).

---

### **2. Using CASE Inside Aggregation**

Example: Count employees within each salary category.

#### Query:
```sql
SELECT 
       CASE 
           WHEN salary >= 7000 THEN 'High'
           WHEN salary >= 5000 THEN 'Medium'
           ELSE 'Low'
       END AS salary_category,
       COUNT(*) AS employee_count
FROM employees
GROUP BY CASE 
           WHEN salary >= 7000 THEN 'High'
           WHEN salary >= 5000 THEN 'Medium'
           ELSE 'Low'
       END;
```

#### Result:
| **salary_category** | **employee_count** |
|---------------------|--------------------|
| High                | 1                  |
| Medium              | 1                  |
| Low                 | 2                  |

**Explanation:**
- The `CASE` statement is used as a calculated column.
- The `GROUP BY` groups rows according to their salary category.

---

### **3. Using Simple CASE to Transform Data**

Example: Replace department IDs with department names.

#### Table: employees

| **employee_id** | **name**    | **department_id** |
|-----------------|-------------|-------------------|
| 1               | Alice       | 101               |
| 2               | Bob         | 102               |
| 3               | Charlie     | 103               |
| 4               | David       | 102               |

#### Query:
```sql
SELECT 
    name, 
    department_id,
    CASE department_id
        WHEN 101 THEN 'HR'
        WHEN 102 THEN 'Finance'
        WHEN 103 THEN 'Engineering'
        ELSE 'Other'
    END AS department_name
FROM employees;
```

#### Result:
| **name**    | **department_id** | **department_name** |
|-------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Alice       | 101               | HR                  |
| Bob         | 102               | Finance             |
| Charlie     | 103               | Engineering         |
| David       | 102               | Finance             |

---

### **4. Combining CASE With Mathematical Expressions**

Example: Give a 10% bonus for salaries above 5000, otherwise no bonus.

#### Query:
```sql
SELECT name, salary,
       CASE
           WHEN salary > 5000 THEN salary * 0.1
           ELSE 0
       END AS bonus
FROM employees;
```

#### Result:
| **name**    | **salary** | **bonus** |
|-------------|------------|-----------|
| Alice       | 6000       | 600       |
| Bob         | 4000       | 0         |
| Charlie     | 7500       | 750       |
| David       | 3000       | 0         |


### **5. Improper Use of Data Types**
- **Error:** `Data type mismatch error.`
- **Cause:** Mixing data types (e.g., returning both numeric and string values as the result of `CASE`).
- **Fix:** Ensure all return values in the `THEN` and `ELSE` clauses are of the **same data type**. For example:
  **Invalid Example:**
  ```sql
  CASE 
      WHEN salary > 5000 THEN 'High'
      ELSE 0
  END
  ```
    - Here, `'High'` is a string and `0` is numeric.

  **Corrected Example:**
  ```sql
  CASE 
      WHEN salary > 5000 THEN 'High'
      ELSE 'Low'
  END
  ```

<h3 align="center">Common Table Expressions (CTEs)</h3>

---

A **Common Table Expression (CTE)** is a temporary result set in SQL that is defined within a query. It's like a named subquery that is easier to read and reuse. CTEs are primarily used to:
- Improve **query readability**.
- Handle **complex logic** by breaking it into smaller, logical steps.
- Simplify queries with **nested subqueries** by giving them meaningful names.

CTEs are particularly useful when the same logic is used multiple times within a query or when working with recursive queries.

---

## **Syntax of a Common Table Expression**

```sql
WITH cte_name AS (
    SELECT column1, column2, ...
    FROM table_name
    WHERE condition
)
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM cte_name;
```

- **`WITH` Keyword**: Introduces the CTE.
- **`cte_name`**: The name of the CTE, which acts like a temporary table.
- **`AS`**: Follows the CTE name and encloses the query that defines the CTE logic.
- **Main Query**: References the CTE as though it is a regular table.

You can define multiple CTEs by separating each one with a comma.

---

## **Features of CTEs**

1. **Scope**:
    - A CTE is only valid for the query it is used in and does not persist after the query execution.
2. **Readability**:
    - CTEs help break down complicated queries with nested subqueries into simpler, modular, and named sections.
3. **Recursion Support**:
    - CTEs allow recursive queries to handle hierarchical data (e.g., employee-manager relationships or organizational structures).

---

## **Examples of Common Table Expressions**

### **1. Basic CTE**

#### Example: Find the employees earning above the average salary.

#### Table: employees

| **employee_id** | **name**    | **department_id** | **salary** |
|-----------------|-------------|-------------------|------------|
| 1               | Alice       | 101               | 6000       |
| 2               | Bob         | 102               | 5000       |
| 3               | Charlie     | 101               | 5500       |
| 4               | David       | 103               | 7000       |

#### Query Using CTE:

```sql
WITH average_salary AS (
    SELECT AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
    FROM employees
)
SELECT name, salary
FROM employees, average_salary
WHERE employees.salary > average_salary.avg_salary;
```

#### Result:
| **name**    | **salary** |
|-------------|------------|
| Alice       | 6000       |
| David       | 7000       |

**Explanation**:
- The CTE `average_salary` calculates the average salary.
- The main query uses the result from the CTE to filter employees earning more than the average.

---

### **2. Using Multiple CTEs**

#### Example: Find the highest-paid employee in each department, along with their department name.

#### Tables:
1. **employees**

   | **employee_id** | **name**    | **department_id** | **salary** |
   |-----------------|-------------|-------------------|------------|
   | 1               | Alice       | 101               | 6000       |
   | 2               | Bob         | 102               | 5000       |
   | 3               | Charlie     | 101               | 5500       |
   | 4               | David       | 103               | 7000       |

2. **departments**

   | **department_id** | **department_name** |
   |-------------------|---------------------|
   | 101               | HR                  |
   | 102               | Finance             |
   | 103               | Engineering         |

#### Query Using Multiple CTEs:

```sql
WITH max_salary_per_department AS (
    SELECT department_id, MAX(salary) AS max_salary
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY department_id
),
highest_paid_employees AS (
    SELECT e.name, e.salary, e.department_id
    FROM employees e
    JOIN max_salary_per_department m
    ON e.department_id = m.department_id AND e.salary = m.max_salary
)
SELECT h.name AS employee_name, h.salary, d.department_name
FROM highest_paid_employees h
JOIN departments d
ON h.department_id = d.department_id;
```

#### Result:
| **employee_name** | **salary** | **department_name** |
|-------------------|------------|---------------------|
| Alice             | 6000       | HR                  |
| Bob               | 5000       | Finance             |
| David             | 7000       | Engineering         |

**Explanation**:
1. The first CTE (`max_salary_per_department`) calculates the maximum salary for each department.
2. The second CTE (`highest_paid_employees`) retrieves the employees who earn this maximum salary.
3. The main query joins the result with the `departments` table to display department names.

---

### **3. Recursive CTE**

Recursive CTEs are used to query hierarchical data, such as organizational structures or parent-child relationships.

#### Example: Retrieve an organizational hierarchy (employee-manager relationships).

#### Table: employees

| **employee_id** | **name**    | **manager_id** |
|-----------------|-------------|----------------|
| 1               | Alice       | NULL           |
| 2               | Bob         | 1              |
| 3               | Charlie     | 1              |
| 4               | David       | 2              |

#### Query Using Recursive CTE:

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE org_hierarchy AS (
    -- Base case: Top-level manager
    SELECT employee_id, name, manager_id, 1 AS level
    FROM employees
    WHERE manager_id IS NULL
    UNION ALL
    -- Recursive case: Employees reporting to the current level
    SELECT e.employee_id, e.name, e.manager_id, h.level + 1
    FROM employees e
    JOIN org_hierarchy h
    ON e.manager_id = h.employee_id
)
SELECT *
FROM org_hierarchy;
```

#### Result:
| **employee_id** | **name**    | **manager_id** | **level** |
|-----------------|-------------|----------------|-----------|
| 1               | Alice       | NULL           | 1         |
| 2               | Bob         | 1              | 2         |
| 3               | Charlie     | 1              | 2         |
| 4               | David       | 2              | 3         |

**Explanation**:
- The recursive CTE starts with the base case, where `manager_id IS NULL` (the top-level manager).
- It then recursively joins with the employees who report to the current level, building the hierarchy step by step.

---

## **Common Errors When Using CTEs**

### **1. Missing CTE Alias**
- **Error**: `Incorrect syntax error.`
- **Cause**: Forgetting to give an alias (name) to the CTE.
- **Example**:
  ```sql
  WITH AS (
      SELECT AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
      FROM employees
  )
  SELECT * FROM avg_salary;
  ```
- **Fix**: Provide a valid alias for the CTE:
  ```sql
  WITH average_salary AS (
      SELECT AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
      FROM employees
  )
  SELECT * FROM average_salary;
  ```

---

### **2. Circular Reference in Recursive CTE without a Base Case**
- **Error**: `Maximum recursion level reached.`
- **Cause**: Recursive CTEs must include a base case; otherwise, they create infinite recursion.
- **Example**:
  ```sql
  WITH RECURSIVE example_cte AS (
      SELECT employee_id FROM employees
      UNION ALL
      SELECT employee_id FROM example_cte
  )
  SELECT * FROM example_cte;
  ```
- **Fix**: Always include a base case to limit recursion:
  ```sql
  WITH RECURSIVE example_cte AS (
      SELECT employee_id FROM employees WHERE manager_id IS NULL -- Base case
      UNION ALL
      SELECT e.employee_id
      FROM employees e
      JOIN example_cte c
      ON e.manager_id = c.employee_id
  )
  SELECT * FROM example_cte;
  ```

<h3 align = "center" >Working with Dates and Times </h3>

---

## **1. Date and Time Data Types in MySQL**
MySQL provides several data types to store date and time information.

| **Data Type** | **Description**                              | **Format Example**                  |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `DATE`        | Only date, in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.           | `2023-03-15`                        |
| `TIME`        | Only time, in `HH:MM:SS` format.             | `14:30:45`                          |
| `DATETIME`    | Date and time, without time zone.            | `2023-03-15 14:30:45`               |
| `TIMESTAMP`   | Date and time, with UTC storage and timezone conversion. | Same as `DATETIME`               |
| `YEAR`        | Only the year, in `YYYY` format.             | `2023`                              |

MySQL also supports **epoch (Unix timestamps)**, which store the number of seconds since `January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC`.

---

## **2. Common Date and Time Functions in MySQL**

### **Getting Current Date and Time**
- `CURDATE()` or `CURRENT_DATE` – Current date.
- `CURTIME()` or `CURRENT_TIME` – Current time.
- `NOW()` – Current date and time.
- `SYSDATE()` – System date and time (can vary if queried repeatedly).

```sql
SELECT CURDATE() AS today, CURTIME() AS now, NOW() AS current_timestamp;
```

---

### **Extracting Components from Dates**
Use functions to extract parts of a date (e.g., year, month, day):
- `YEAR(date)`
- `MONTH(date)`
- `DAY(date)`
- `HOUR(time)`
- `MINUTE(time)`
- `SECOND(time)`

```sql
SELECT 
    YEAR(NOW()) AS year, 
    MONTH(NOW()) AS month, 
    DAY(NOW()) AS day,
    HOUR(NOW()) AS hour;
```

---

### **Formatting Dates**
Use `DATE_FORMAT()` to format dates into a readable or custom format:

```sql
SELECT DATE_FORMAT(NOW(), '%M %d, %Y - %H:%i:%s') AS formatted_date;
```

| **Symbol** | **Description**            | **Example Output**        |
|------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|
| `%Y`       | Year (4 digits)            | `2023`                    |
| `%m`       | Month (2 digits)           | `03`                      |
| `%b`       | Abbreviated month name     | `Mar`                     |
| `%d`       | Day of the month           | `15`                      |
| `%H`       | Hour in 24-hour format     | `14`                      |
| `%h`       | Hour in 12-hour format     | `02`                      |
| `%i`       | Minutes (2 digits)         | `30`                      |
| `%p`       | AM or PM                   | `PM`                      |

---

### **Date Arithmetic**
MySQL provides functions to **add/subtract** from dates and calculate differences.

#### Adding/Subtracting
- `DATE_ADD(date, INTERVAL value unit)`
- `DATE_SUB(date, INTERVAL value unit)`

```sql
SELECT 
    DATE_ADD(NOW(), INTERVAL 7 DAY) AS next_week,
    DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 1 MONTH) AS last_month;
```

#### Getting Date Difference
- Use `DATEDIFF(date1, date2)` to calculate days between two dates.

```sql
SELECT DATEDIFF('2023-03-15', '2023-03-01') AS difference_in_days;
```

---

## **3. Dealing with Epoch (Unix Time) in MySQL**

Epoch time is used to store dates and times as integers, representing seconds since `1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC`.

---

### **Epoch -> Human-Readable Date**
Convert epoch to MySQL `DATETIME` format using `FROM_UNIXTIME()`:

```sql
SELECT FROM_UNIXTIME(1678876800) AS readable_date;
```

**Result:**

| **readable_date**        |
|--------------------------|
| 2023-03-15 00:00:00      |

---

### **Human-Readable Date -> Epoch**
Convert MySQL `DATETIME` to epoch using `UNIX_TIMESTAMP()`:

```sql
SELECT UNIX_TIMESTAMP('2023-03-15 00:00:00') AS epoch_time;
```

**Result:**

| **epoch_time**   |
|------------------|
| 1678876800       |

#### Current Epoch Time:
```sql
SELECT UNIX_TIMESTAMP() AS current_epoch;
```

**Result:**

| **current_epoch** |
|-------------------|
| 1678876992        |

---

### **Filtering Data with Epoch**
When working with epoch for filtering data (e.g., logs), you can use `FROM_UNIXTIME()` or `UNIX_TIMESTAMP()`.

#### Example: Retrieve logs from the last 7 days:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM logs
WHERE epoch_time >= UNIX_TIMESTAMP(DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 7 DAY));
```

#### Example: Retrieve specific time periods:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM logs
WHERE epoch_time BETWEEN UNIX_TIMESTAMP('2023-03-01') AND UNIX_TIMESTAMP('2023-03-10');
```

---

### **Storing Epoch Timestamps**
- Use `BIGINT` for epoch timestamps to avoid overflow.
- If millisecond precision is used (13-digit epoch), divide the value by `1000` before processing it.

```sql
-- Storing millisecond epoch time
SELECT FROM_UNIXTIME(epoch_in_milliseconds / 1000) AS readable_date;
```

---

## **4. Real-World Use Cases**

### **1. Retrieving Current Month's Orders**
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM orders
WHERE YEAR(order_date) = YEAR(CURDATE()) 
  AND MONTH(order_date) = MONTH(CURDATE());
```

---

### **2. Generating a Monthly Sales Report**
```sql
SELECT 
    DATE_FORMAT(order_date, '%Y-%m') AS month, 
    SUM(order_total) AS total_sales
FROM orders
GROUP BY DATE_FORMAT(order_date, '%Y-%m');
```

---

### **3. Scheduling Notifications**
Schedule notifications 2 days before subscription expiry:
```sql
SELECT user_id, subscription_end_date 
FROM subscriptions
WHERE DATE_SUB(subscription_end_date, INTERVAL 2 DAY) = CURDATE();
```

---

### **4. Handling Epoch in Logs**
Retrieve logs with epoch timestamps converted to human-readable format:
```sql
SELECT 
    log_id, 
    FROM_UNIXTIME(epoch_time) AS readable_time,
    event_data
FROM logs;
```

---

### **5. Filtering Events Logged Over the Last Hour**
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM logs
WHERE epoch_time >= UNIX_TIMESTAMP(NOW() - INTERVAL 1 HOUR);
```

---

## **5. Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them**

### **1. Incorrect Date Format**
- **Issue**: Using unsupported formats like `DD/MM/YYYY`.
- **Fix**: Always use `YYYY-MM-DD` for dates in MySQL.

---

### **2. Forgetting Time Zones**
- **Issue**: Epoch and `DATETIME` may not align due to timezone differences.
- **Fix**: Use `CONVERT_TZ()` to manage time zones.

```sql
SELECT 
    CONVERT_TZ(FROM_UNIXTIME(epoch_time), 'UTC', 'America/New_York') AS local_time
FROM logs;
```

---

### **3. Using BETWEEN Inclusivity Incorrectly**
- **Issue**: `BETWEEN` is inclusive, so the start and end dates might include unwanted records.
- **Fix**: Use proper boundary conditions with `>` and `<` if required.

---

### **4. Misinterpreting Milliseconds in Epoch**
- **Issue**: Many systems store epoch timestamps in milliseconds (13 digits).
- **Fix**: Divide by `1000` to convert milliseconds to seconds.

```sql
SELECT FROM_UNIXTIME(epoch_time / 1000) AS readable_date FROM logs;
```

---

### **5. Handling NULL Values in Date Columns**
- **Issue**: NULL dates may break arithmetic operations.
- **Fix**: Use `COALESCE()` to replace NULL values.

```sql
SELECT COALESCE(delivery_date, '1900-01-01') AS safe_delivery_date FROM orders;
```

---

### **6. Overcomplicating Date Filters**
- **Issue**: Writing overly complex subqueries for date calculations.
- **Fix**: Use native functions like `DATEDIFF()`, `DATE_ADD()`, and `UNIX_TIMESTAMP()`.

---

## **6. Best Practices for Handling Dates and Epoch in MySQL**

1. **Always Use `YYYY-MM-DD` for Dates**:
   Stick to ISO format to avoid issues.

2. **Use Epoch Time for Performance-Critical Systems**:
   Use `BIGINT` to store epoch and convert on read for better performance.

3. **Normalize Time Zones**:
   Store UTC dates and convert to local time when needed using `CONVERT_TZ()`.

4. **Handle Edge Cases**:
   Test with:
    - Leap years (e.g., `2024-02-29`).
    - Daylight savings.

5. **Do Not Mix Formats**:
   Use epoch consistently in systems where required, or else convert to `DATETIME`.

6. **Use Proper Functions**:
   Take advantage of MySQL’s built-in date functions for filtering, formatting, and arithmetic instead of manual calculation.

<h3 align = "center">Optimizing SQL Queries | Improving Performance with Indexing and Query Plans</h3>

---

Efficient SQL query optimization is critical for ensuring a database system performs effectively, especially as the volume of data grows. Two essential areas for enhancing performance are **indexing** and understanding **query execution plans**. This document explores how to optimize SQL queries using these tools.

---

## **1. Why Optimize SQL Queries?**

Inefficient SQL queries can lead to:

- **Slower Response Time:** Complex or unoptimized queries take longer to execute, affecting user experience.
- **High Resource Usage:** Poorly written queries can strain system resources (CPU, memory, and I/O), impacting overall server performance.
- **Cost Inefficiency:** For cloud-based databases with usage pricing, inefficient queries can directly increase costs.
- **Scalability Issues:** Unoptimized queries may not perform well as the data grows.

**Optimization** improves database performance by enabling queries to run faster, reducing resource consumption, and ensuring better scalability.

---

## **2. Indexing in SQL**

### **What is an Index?**
An index is a data structure (usually a B-Tree or Hash structure) that database systems use to quickly locate rows in a table without scanning the entire table. It is similar to the index in a book, which allows users to quickly find information based on keywords.

### **How Indexes Work**

- Indexes create pointers to the actual data.
- When a query is executed, the database uses the index to quickly identify the rows that match the condition, avoiding a **full table scan**.

---

### **Types of Indexes**

1. **Primary Index** (Clustered Index):
    - The primary index is automatically created when you define a primary key on a table.
    - It determines the physical order of rows in a table.
    - Only one clustered index is allowed per table.

2. **Secondary Index** (Non-clustered Index):
    - A secondary or non-clustered index is created explicitly and does not affect the physical order of a table.
    - It is used to query columns other than the primary key or clustering key.

3. **Unique Index**:
    - Ensures that the values in an indexed column are unique.

4. **Composite Index**:
    - Created on multiple columns, useful for queries involving conditions on multiple fields (e.g., `WHERE column1 = value1 AND column2 = value2`).

5. **Full Text Index**:
    - Used for full-text searches (e.g., searching substrings in large text fields).

6. **Bitmap Index** (Used in Data Warehousing):
    - Best suited for columns with low cardinality (e.g., columns with Yes/No or Male/Female).

---

### **When to Use Indexes**

- When querying specific columns frequently in `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`, or `JOIN` clauses.
- On columns with **high cardinality** (high number of unique values).
- On foreign keys in relationships between tables.

**Avoid indexing:**
- Columns with **low cardinality** (e.g., Boolean values like `1/0`, `true/false`).
- Columns that are rarely queried.
- Tables with frequent INSERTs, UPDATEs, or DELETEs, as indexes slow down write operations.

---

### **Advantages of Indexing**

- Faster query execution by reducing the number of rows scanned.
- Indexes improve the performance of `JOIN`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, and `ORDER BY` queries.
- Helps enforce unique data integrity.
- Improves lookup performance, especially in large datasets.

---

### **Disadvantages of Indexing**

- **Storage Space**: Indexes require additional disk space.
- **Impact on Write Operations**: INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations become slower because the index must be updated alongside the data.
- **Complexity**: Poorly designed indexes can hurt performance rather than improve it.

---

## **3. Query Execution Plans**

### **What is a Query Execution Plan?**

A query execution plan is a breakdown of how the database engine executes a given query. It provides insight into:

- The order of operations (e.g., JOIN, SORT, SCAN).
- How tables are accessed (e.g., index scan, sequential scan).
- Expected cost and execution time for each step.

---

### **How to Generate an Execution Plan**

1. **MySQL**: Use the `EXPLAIN` or `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` statement.
   ```sql
   EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = 5;
   ```
2. **PostgreSQL**: Use `EXPLAIN` or `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`.
3. **SQL Server**: Use the "Execution Plan" option in SQL Server Management Studio.

---

### **Key Components of an Execution Plan**

1. **Access Type**:
    - **ALL**: A full table scan (least efficient).
    - **INDEX**: The query uses an index to fetch rows.
    - **RANGE**: The query accesses a range of rows from an index.
    - **UNIQUE**: For unique index lookups.
    - **REF**: For non-unique index lookups.

2. **Join Types**:
    - **Nested Loop Join**: Iterates over one table for each matching row in another.
    - **Hash Join**: Creates a hash table for better performance on equality joins.
    - **Merge Join**: Sorts both inputs before joining.

3. **Indexes and Scans**:
    - **Index Scan**: Only scans the relevant rows using an index.
    - **Sequential Scan**: Scans the entire table (slow for large tables).
    - **Index Seek**: Fetches rows using the index in an optimized manner.

4. **Estimated Cost**:
    - Provides the estimated cost for each operation in the query. Lower costs indicate better performance.

---

### **How to Interpret Execution Plans**

- Look for **full table scans** or operations with **high costs.**
- Ensure frequently filtered columns are covered by indexes.
- If joins or sorting is expensive, consider optimizing with indexes or rewriting queries.

*Example of an improvement based on plan analysis:*
- Statement: `SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = 5;`
- With no index on `customer_id`, a **full table scan** is performed.
- Add an index:
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX idx_customer_id ON orders (customer_id);
  ```

---

## **4. Query Optimization Techniques**

### **A. Optimize for Indexing**

1. **Choose Proper Columns for Indexing**:
    - Frequently used for filtering (`WHERE` clause).
    - Columns used in `JOIN`, `ORDER BY`, or `GROUP BY`.

2. **Limit Columns in an Index**:
    - Avoid indexing all columns in a table.
    - Use composite indexes for queries with multiple conditions.

3. **Use Covering Indexes**:
    - Include all the columns needed in the query to avoid accessing the table unnecessarily.

   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX idx_order_customer ON orders (customer_id, order_date);
   ```

---

### **B. Rewrite Queries for Better Performance**

1. **Avoid `SELECT *`**:
    - Only retrieve the columns you need.

   ```sql
   SELECT id, customer_name FROM customers;
   ```

2. **Use EXISTS Instead of JOIN**:
    - `EXISTS` is generally faster when checking the existence of rows.

   ```sql
   SELECT 1 
   FROM customers 
   WHERE EXISTS (
       SELECT 1 FROM orders WHERE orders.customer_id = customers.id
   );
   ```

3. **Filter Early**:
    - Apply filters in subqueries or joins to reduce the dataset as early as possible.

4. **Restrict the Dataset**:
    - Use `LIMIT` or `TOP` when only a subset of data is needed.

5. **Avoid Functions on Indexed Columns**:
    - Functions like `UPPER(column)` or `DATE(column)` prevent the use of indexes.

   ```sql
   -- Bad
   SELECT * FROM orders WHERE DATE(order_date) = CURDATE();

   -- Optimized
   SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_date >= CURDATE() AND order_date < CURDATE() + INTERVAL 1 DAY;
   ```

---

### **C. Partitioning Large Tables**

1. **What is Partitioning?**
    - Splitting a table into smaller, more manageable pieces.
    - MySQL supports range, list, and hash partitioning.

2. **When to Use Partitioning?**
    - For tables with millions of rows where queries frequently retrieve data for specific ranges.

---

## **5. Common Mistakes and Anti-Patterns**

1. **Neglecting Index Maintenance:**
    - Regularly analyze and drop unused indexes to conserve resources.

2. **Overloading with Too Many Indexes:**
    - Excessive indexes degrade performance for `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`.

3. **Using Inefficient Join Order:**
    - Always filter or limit rows in joins early in the query.

4. **Ignoring Query Execution Plans:**
    - Execution plans are vital for spotting inefficiencies (e.g., full table scans).

5. **Relying on Temporary Tables/Derived Tables:**
    - Rewrite queries to avoid unnecessary temporary structures.

---

## **6. Key Takeaways**

- **Indexes** are the backbone of query performance. Use them wisely on frequently queried columns to minimize table scanning.
- **Query execution plans** are invaluable tools for understanding database query performance. Regularly review them for bottlenecks.
- Rewrite queries to eliminate unnecessary overhead and optimize for indexing.
- Proper indexing and query performance optimization ensure that your database remains scalable as your data grows.

<h3 align = "center"> Understanding the Output of the `EXPLAIN` Command in MySQL </h3>

The `EXPLAIN` command in MySQL is your best friend when it comes to understanding how your query is executed by the database. It gives you an insight into the **query execution plan**, showing what the database will do step-by-step to produce the results. However, the output can look overwhelming at first glance. Don't worry—I’ll break it down into simple and relatable terms!

---

## **What Is `EXPLAIN`?**
`EXPLAIN` provides a breakdown of how MySQL processes a query, including things like:
- Which tables are accessed.
- The order in which they’re accessed.
- Whether indexes are used or not.
- The approximate cost of executing the query.

### **Syntax**
```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name = 'value';
```

---

## **Typical Output Columns of `EXPLAIN`**

Running the `EXPLAIN` command will return a table with several columns. Here’s an explanation of the key columns you’ll see, with real-world analogies to help you understand them:

| **Column**       | **What It Means**                                                                                                    | **Real-World Analogy**                                                                                               |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `id`             | The sequence number of the query execution step.                                                                    | Think of this as the "step number" in a list of instructions for MySQL to achieve the result.                       |
| `select_type`    | The type of query (e.g., simple, subquery, derived, etc.).                                                           | Different tools in a toolbox: the way MySQL processes your query might depend on tools like primary selects or joins. |
| `table`          | The table being accessed during this step.                                                                          | Imagine it as the book (your table) MySQL is consulting to find the answer to your question.                        |
| `type`           | The type of table access (e.g., full table scan, index lookup, etc.).                                                | This tells you if MySQL is skimming the surface (using an index) or flipping through every page (full table scan).   |
| `possible_keys`  | The indexes that could potentially be used for the query.                                                           | Think of these as "shortcuts" MySQL could potentially use to find your data faster.                                 |
| `key`            | The specific index MySQL decided to use.                                                                            | MySQL picks the "best shortcut" (index) for efficiency.                                                             |
| `key_len`        | The length of the index used (in bytes).                                                                             | How much of the index MySQL used (e.g., part of the book's title vs. the whole thing).                              |
| `ref`            | The column or constant being used to match the index.                                                               | Like saying, "Look for all books where the author's name is this specific value."                                   |
| `rows`           | The estimated number of rows MySQL will examine to find the result.                                                 | This shows how many "books" (rows) MySQL needs to look through to find the answer.                                  |
| `filtered`       | The percentage of rows filtered by the conditions in the `WHERE` clause (% of rows passing the condition).           | Imagine if you're filtering through books for specific chapters—only a % of them meet the condition.                |
| `Extra`          | Additional information about the query execution (e.g., `Using index`, `Using temporary`, etc.).                     | Think of it as notes about whether MySQL is performing extra work, like sorting, buffering, or fully using an index. |

---

## **Breaking Down the `EXPLAIN` Output with an Example**

### Suppose the Query:
```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT * 
FROM orders 
WHERE customer_id = 5;
```

Let’s assume the `orders` table contains the following:
- **Columns:** `order_id`, `customer_id`, `order_date`, `order_amount`.
- **Index:** There’s an index on the `customer_id` column.

Here’s the sample output of `EXPLAIN`:

| **id** | **select_type** | **table** | **type** | **possible_keys** | **key**        | **key_len** | **ref**       | **rows** | **filtered** | **Extra**       |
|--------|-----------------|-----------|----------|--------------------|----------------|-------------|---------------|----------|--------------|-----------------|
| 1      | SIMPLE          | orders    | ref      | idx_customer_id    | idx_customer_id | 4           | const         | 100      | 100          | Using where     |

---

### Explaining Each Column with an Analogy

1. **`id`:**
    - It’s "1" here because this query only involves one step to retrieve data.
    - **Analogy:** Imagine it as the first (and only) task MySQL performs to execute the query.

2. **`select_type`:**
    - Value: `SIMPLE` – Indicates this is a simple SELECT query, without subqueries or UNIONs.
    - **Analogy:** It’s like saying, "This is a straightforward task—find the data directly in one table."

3. **`table`:**
    - Value: `orders` – This is the table MySQL is reading data from.
    - **Analogy:** Think of this as the specific "book" (table) MySQL is opening.

4. **`type`:**
    - Value: `ref` – This means MySQL is using an index to fetch rows.
        - **Common Types:**
            - `ALL`: Full table scan (worst case).
            - `index`: Scans all rows of the index.
            - `ref`: Uses an index with matching conditions.
            - `eq_ref`: A perfect match using a unique index (best case).
    - **Analogy:** MySQL isn’t flipping through the whole book—it’s using the index, like checking the table of contents or an author's name to find relevant pages.

5. **`possible_keys`:**
    - Value: `idx_customer_id` – Indicates that the `customer_id` index can potentially help in this query.
    - **Analogy:** These are all the "shortcuts" MySQL could consider using in this query.

6. **`key`:**
    - Value: `idx_customer_id` – This is the specific index MySQL decided to use.
    - **Analogy:** MySQL picked the best shortcut to find the rows faster.

7. **`key_len`:**
    - Value: `4` – This means that MySQL used 4 bytes from the index. For example:
        - If the column is an integer (`INT`), and each integer is 4 bytes, the entire column was utilized.
    - **Analogy:** If the index is like book titles, the length tells you how much of the title was used to locate the pages.

8. **`ref`:**
    - Value: `const` – MySQL is comparing the indexed column (`customer_id`) to the constant value `5`.
    - **Analogy:** MySQL is looking for specific "books" (rows) authored by `customer_id = 5`.

9. **`rows`:**
    - Value: `100` – This is an estimate of the number of rows MySQL might need to check for the query.
    - **Analogy:** MySQL predicts it’ll scan 100 books (rows) to find the answer.

10. **`filtered`:**
    - Value: `100` – 100% of rows match the condition after applying the `WHERE` clause.
    - **Analogy:** If MySQL picks up 100 books, all of them meet the condition.

11. **`Extra`:**
    - Value: `Using where` – Indicates MySQL is applying additional filtering on the rows to ensure they meet the `WHERE` condition.
    - **Analogy:** Even when following the index, MySQL double-checks the remaining rows to confirm correctness.

## **Real-World Analogy**

### Scenario: Finding Orders

Imagine you’re a librarian, and you need to find orders placed by customer #5 in a giant library of business records (your database). Here’s how you would go about it:

1. **No Index:**
    - Without an index, you’d read every page in every book in the library (full table scan), looking for orders from customer #5. Tedious, right?

2. **With an Index:**
    - With an index, it’s like having a list of page numbers based on customer names (or IDs). Instead of looking at every page, you jump directly to the pages relevant to customer #5.

## **Common Query Optimization Tips**

1. **Avoid Full Table Scans:**
    - If you see `ALL` in the `type` column, consider creating an index for the columns in the `WHERE` or `JOIN` conditions.

2. **Check the Rows Estimate:**
    - If `rows` shows a very high number, consider adding indexes or narrowing your query conditions.

3. **Minimize the "Extra" Work:**
    - If `Extra` lists things like `Using temporary` or `Using filesort`, it may indicate inefficiencies.
    - Rewrite the query or add indexes to avoid these.

4. **Prefer Covering Indexes:**
    - If possible, design your indexes to include all the columns required by your query (e.g., SELECT and WHERE).
